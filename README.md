##task1:todo_list
Introduction
A to-do list application is a simple and effective tool for task management. It helps users keep track of tasks, prioritize them, and ensure that important activities are not forgotten. In this document, we will discuss the theoretical aspects of creating a to-do list application using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

Requirements
Python: Python is a versatile programming language that supports various libraries and frameworks, making it an ideal choice for developing GUI applications.
tkinter: tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit in Python. It provides a simple way to create windows, dialogs, and other GUI elements.
Design and Functionality
The to-do list application will have the following features:

Add Task: Allows the user to add a new task to the list.
View Tasks: Displays all the tasks in the list.
Delete Task: Enables the user to delete a selected task from the list.
Persistent Storage: Saves tasks to a file so that they are retained even after the application is closed.
Components and Structure
1. Main Window
The main window is the primary interface where users interact with the application. It includes:

An entry field for inputting new tasks.
Buttons for adding and deleting tasks.
A listbox to display the tasks.
2. Task Storage
Tasks are stored in a JSON file (tasks.json). JSON is chosen because it is easy to read and write, and it is a widely used format for data interchange.

Implementation
1. Loading and Saving Tasks
To ensure tasks are persistent, they are saved to a file when added or deleted and loaded from the file when the application starts.

Load Tasks: Reads the tasks from the JSON file into a list.
Save Tasks: Writes the list of tasks to the JSON file.
2. Adding a Task
When a user inputs a task and clicks the "Add Task" button:

The input is validated to ensure it is not empty.
The task is added to the list.
The list of tasks is saved to the JSON file.
The task list is updated in the listbox.
3. Viewing Tasks
All tasks are displayed in a listbox. When tasks are loaded or modified, the listbox is updated to reflect the current list of tasks.

4. Deleting a Task
When a user selects a task and clicks the "Delete Task" button:

The selected task is identified by its index in the listbox.
The task is removed from the list.
The updated list of tasks is saved to the JSON file.
The task list is updated in the listbox.

##task2:calculater
Introduction
A calculator application is a fundamental tool for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Creating a calculator using Python and the tkinter library provides a practical example of GUI programming. This document discusses the theoretical aspects of developing a calculator application.

Requirements
Python: Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and versatility, making it suitable for GUI applications.
tkinter: tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit in Python, providing an easy way to create windows, buttons, and other graphical elements.
Design and Functionality
The calculator application will have the following features:

Display Screen: Shows the current input and results.
Numeric Buttons: Allows the user to input numbers (0-9).
Operator Buttons: Includes buttons for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
Equal Button: Computes the result of the entered expression.
Clear Button: Clears the input and display.
Components and Structure
1. Main Window
The main window is the primary interface where users interact with the calculator. It includes:

An entry field for displaying input and results.
Buttons for digits and operations arranged in a grid layout.
2. Button Functions
Each button performs a specific action:

Numeric Buttons: Append the corresponding digit to the current input.
Operator Buttons: Append the corresponding operator to the current input.
Equal Button: Evaluate the current expression and display the result.
Clear Button: Clear the current input and display.
Implementation
1. Button Click Handling
A function handles button clicks, updating the display based on the button pressed.

2. Expression Evaluation
The equal button triggers evaluation of the current expression using Python's eval function, which parses the string expression and computes the result.

3. Clearing the Display
The clear button resets the display to an empty state.

##task3:random_password_generator
Introduction
A random password generator is a useful tool for creating strong, secure passwords. This application can generate passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring high security. We will develop a random password generator using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

Requirements
Python: Python is a powerful and versatile programming language suitable for various applications, including GUI development.
tkinter: tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit in Python, allowing easy creation of windows, buttons, and other interface elements.
random: The random module in Python is used to generate random sequences, essential for creating unpredictable passwords.
Design and Functionality
The random password generator will have the following features:

Password Length Input: Allows the user to specify the desired length of the password.
Include Options: Options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Generate Password: A button to generate the password based on the specified criteria.
Display Password: An area to display the generated password.
Copy to Clipboard: A button to copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.
Components and Structure
1. Main Window
The main window is the primary interface where users interact with the application. It includes:

An entry field for specifying the password length.
Checkbuttons for including different character types.
A button to generate the password.
An entry field to display the generated password.
A button to copy the password to the clipboard.
2. Password Generation Logic
The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from the specified sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) based on the user's choices.

Implementation
1. Generating the Password
The password is generated by:

Collecting the chosen character sets.
Randomly selecting characters from these sets until the desired length is reached.
Shuffling the characters to ensure randomness.
2. Copying to Clipboard
The generated password can be copied to the clipboard using the clipboard_clear and clipboard_append methods from tkinter.

##task4:rock_paper_scissors
Introduction
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. This game is an excellent example for demonstrating basic game logic and user interface design. We will create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).
